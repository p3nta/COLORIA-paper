Located to the east of COLORIA, the Dawn Lake shines with a gentle and soothing light at the first glimmers of the day. It is surrounded by exotic plants and colorful flowers that bloom with the first rays of sunlight. The shores are lined with exotic plants and strange flowers, and fascinating aquatic creatures hide in the depths.

This main lake has an enchanting beauty with an iridescent color reflecting that of the "rainbow" ring surrounding the planet, giving it a magical ambiance. The shores are carpeted with lush vegetation, including fruit bushes with exotic fruits and equally strange yet vibrant flowers. The crystal-clear water allows for a view of the underwater plants and marine creatures swimming below the surface. Fantastic creatures like mermaids, seahorses, and water dragons hide in the depths. Mermaids are said to be the water guardians closely connected with Neluba, singing mesmerizing melodies to protect the lake from malicious intruders. Seahorses are considered loyal mounts for travelers seeking to explore the lake's depths.

The Dawn Lake hosts a large fine-sand beach, with its shimmering turquoise water offering numerous activities and water games. The palm tree and tropical plant-lined beach will also be conducive to activities, meetings, and relaxation. Brightly colored tropical fish swim below the surface, while unique birds fly overhead or perch on the surrounding trees.
