Located at the summit of the crystal mountains, the Ice Lake is governed by eternal snow and freezing temperatures. However, a rich flora and fauna have found refuge there, offering a unique and captivating ambiance.

The shores lined with rocks and roots are surrounded by wildflowers, fruit trees, and flowering trees. This lake could be home to newts and salamanders that live in the depths, while colorful dragonflies and butterflies fly around the trees and flowers.

We can also imagine a waterfall that descends from the mountains and ends in the lake, allowing numerous rivers and streams to take this lake as a starting point thanks to the infinite water drawn from the snowy mountain.
