The Depths Lake, located in a secret area of the forest, is the most mysterious and deepest of the three lakes. Its dark waters conceal unfathomable secrets, and a strange and fascinating fauna has taken refuge there. The melancholic song of these creatures resonates through the surrounding valleys.

The shores of the lake are marshy, with carnivorous plants standing among the reeds. Frogs and toads, with a reimagined style, hide in the tall grass and jump on the water lilies. Water snakes can be spotted gliding beneath the surface. The lake is small but of impressive depth, giving it a dark and mysterious ambiance.
