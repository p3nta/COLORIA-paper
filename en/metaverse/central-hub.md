The Central Hub of COLORIA is a breathtaking place, filled with lush vegetation, majestic trees, bushes, and winding streams that snake through the streets. Skyscrapers stand proudly in the midst of this urban jungle, entirely covered in greenery that makes them almost invisible. This magical place is the gateway to the world of COLORIA, where Colorians are warmly welcomed by the city's guardian.
