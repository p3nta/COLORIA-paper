# Presentation

COLORIA is a revolutionary metaverse built on the Ternoa blockchain, a blockchain specifically designed to natively explore all the best features of NFTs, a perfect solution to meet the needs of the COLORIA metaverse. This specificity allows us to design a richer and more complete "creator" experience by exploiting the innovative features that Ternoa offers, such as Time Capsules, gToken, Secret NFT, Soulbound Token, lending, etc.&#x20;

COLORIA is a 3D virtual universe where users have the opportunity to explore a multitude of distinct spaces, each containing unique activities and opportunities. The vision of COLORIA is to create a metaverse where "creators" can freely express themselves, explore their creativity and imagination, and interact with a community of like-minded people without constraints and create what we call the "**creative economy**".&#x20;

We believe that the metaverse can be a platform for personal development, learning and self-discovery, and we aim to create an immersive digital space where these objectives can be achieved. COLORIA encourages creativity, imagination, emotion, and intuition. We see these aspects as essential to a fulfilling life and have created COLORIA to amplify them.
