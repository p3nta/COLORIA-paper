COLORIA is a revolutionary metaverse built on the Ternoa blockchain, which is specifically dedicated to NFTs. This unique feature allows us to craft a richer and more comprehensive user experience by leveraging the innovative functionalities that Ternoa provides, such as Time Capsules, gToken, Secret NFTs, the Soulbound Token, and more. COLORIA presents itself as a 3D virtual universe where users have the opportunity to explore a multitude of distinct spaces, each housing unique activities and opportunities.

The vision of COLORIA is to create a metaverse where users can freely express themselves, explore their creativity and imagination, and interact with a community of like-minded individuals. We believe the metaverse can be a platform for personal development, learning, and self-discovery, and we aim to create a digital space where these goals can be achieved.

Our metaverse is unique in that it is right-brain focused, and encourages creativity, imagination, emotion, and intuition. We believe these aspects are essential for a fulfilling life and we have created COLORIA to highlight them.

In COLORIA, Colorians can discover a variety of different zones, each with its own ambiance and activities. To enter COLORIA, there are two ways: owning one of the NFTs from the T-Ring collection or a T-Squad, each offering unique experiences. We believe COLORIA is the next evolution of virtual worlds, and we are excited to share this vision with you.

Join us in discovering a world where your right brain can freely express itself and the possibilities are endless.
