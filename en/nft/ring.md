## Distribution

At COLORIA, we like to innovate and have thus created a new way to distribute COLORIA's "Ring".&#x20;

By offering increasing benefits to holders who join the project early, this approach will stimulate investor engagement from the beginning.

The distribution of 4000 Rings per level, with increasing prices and decreasing benefits, will enhance our ability to reward and retain those who believe in our project, thereby creating a real advantage for them.
